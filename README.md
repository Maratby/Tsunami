# Tsunami | Fusing every vanilla joker with Splash

Requires Fusion Jokers mod (https://github.com/lshtech/Fusion-Jokers)
The version linked here is Elbe's fork, fixing the issues with the rarity method presented by a Steamodded update.

I am going to fuse every vanilla Joker with Splash... Eventually.

Currently contains 26 fusions between Splash and Vanilla Jokers! See the Collection ingame for more information!

(Not every joker has art at the moment. The remaining jokers use placeholder art of their material joker that isn't Splash)

One Tarot card,
- Aeon: Creates Splash (must have room)

One Spectral card,
- Polymorph: Creates Splash and 1 random Non-Legendary joker with a Splash fusion (must have room), -1 Hand Size

And one Deck!
- Splash Deck: Start with 2 Negative Eternal copies of Splash and $5

I'll add CardSleeves support for the Splash Deck at some point, but this is low on priority.

Cross-Mod Fusions available! I'll be working on more of these very soon, right now there is only one:
- Cryptid's Sob

Cross-Mod Fusions can be disabled in the Mod Config menu.

Also introducing Gold Fusions! Fuse a second Splash with a Splash fusion Joker at a high price to power up its effects! Currently, only two fusions have Gold variants:
- Splish Splash
- Reflection

More to come with time.

Gold Fusions can be disabled in the Mod Config menu.
