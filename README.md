# Tsunami | Fusing every vanilla joker with Splash

Requires Fusion Jokers mod (https://github.com/itayfeder/Fusion-Jokers)

I am going to fuse every vanilla Joker with Splash... Eventually.

Currently contains 15 fusions between Splash and the following jokers:
- Half Joker
- Stencil Joker
- Hiker
- Fibonacci
- Ramen
- Riff Raff
- Throwback
- Flower Pot
- Sock and Buskin
- Steel Joker
- Hanging Chad
- Credit Card
- Ancient Joker
- Stuntman
- Any Vanilla Legendary (They all make the same thing, this *might* change in the future)

(Not every joker has art at the moment. The remaining jokers use placeholder art of their material joker that isn't Splash)

One Tarot card,
- Aeon: Creates Splash (must have room)
One Spectral card,
- Polymorph: Creates Splash and 1 random Non-Legendary joker that has a Splash fusion (must have room), -1 Hand Size
And one Deck!
- Splash Deck: Start with 2 Negative Eternal copies of Splash and $5
