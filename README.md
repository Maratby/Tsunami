# Tsunami | Fusing every vanilla joker with Splash

Requires Fusion Jokers mod (https://github.com/wingedcatgirl/Fusion-Jokers/tree/block-ingredience)
The version linked here is Minty's fork, fixing the issues with Jokers not using bettercalc methods and enabling a config to block materials.

I am going to fuse every vanilla Joker with Splash... Eventually.

Currently contains 40+ fusions between Splash and Vanilla Jokers! See the Collection ingame for more information!
For once I can say, a lot of them have original art! I'm getting my shit together on that. Woohoo..

Contains many, many additional ways to gain Splash or Splash copies outside the joker pool, and an enhancement to support Splash builds.

Cross-Mod Fusions available! I'll be working on more of these later, right now there are two:
- MoreFluff's Philosophical Joker
- MoreFluff's Basepaul Card

Cross-Mod Fusions can be disabled in the Mod Config menu.

Also introducing Gold Fusions! Fuse a second Splash with a Splash fusion Joker at a high price to power up its effects! Currently, four fusions have Gold variants:
- Splish Splash
- Reflection
- Cryomancer
- Marie

More to come with time.

Gold Fusions can be disabled in the Mod Config menu.
