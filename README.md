# Tsunami | Fusing every vanilla joker with Splash

Requires Fusion Jokers mod (https://github.com/itayfeder/Fusion-Jokers)

I am going to fuse every vanilla Joker with Splash... Eventually.

Currently contains 10 fusions between Splash and the following jokers:
- Half Joker
- Stencil Joker
- Hiker
- Fibonacci
- Ramen
- Riff Raff
- Throwback
- Flower Pot
- Sock and Buskin
- Any Vanilla Legendary (They all make the same thing, this *might* change in the future)

(Only the legendary fusion has art right now. The other jokers use placeholder art of their material joker that isn't Splash)

One tarot card,
- Aeon: Creates Splash (must have room)

And one Deck!
- Splash Deck: Start with 2 Negative Eternal copies of Splash and $5
