# Tsunami | Fusing every vanilla joker with Splash

Requires Fusion Jokers mod (https://github.com/lshtech/Fusion-Jokers)
The version linked here is Elbe's fork, fixing the issues with the rarity method presented by a Steamodded update (and providing other changes to the mod)

I am going to fuse every vanilla Joker with Splash... Eventually.

Currently contains 30 fusions between Splash and Vanilla Jokers! See the Collection ingame for more information!
For once I can say, a lot of them have original art! I'm getting my shit together on that. Woohoo..

Contains many, many additional ways to gain Splash or Splash copies outside the joker pool!

Cross-Mod Fusions available! I'll be working on more of these very soon, right now there is only one:
- Cryptid's Sob

Cross-Mod Fusions can be disabled in the Mod Config menu.

Also introducing Gold Fusions! Fuse a second Splash with a Splash fusion Joker at a high price to power up its effects! Currently, only two fusions have Gold variants:
- Splish Splash
- Reflection
- Marie

More to come with time.

Gold Fusions can be disabled in the Mod Config menu.
