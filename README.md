# Tsunami | Fusing every vanilla joker with Splash

Requires Fusion Jokers mod (https://github.com/lshtech/Fusion-Jokers)
The version linked here is Elbe's fork, fixing the issues with the rarity method presented by a Steamodded update (and providing other changes to the mod)

I am going to fuse every vanilla Joker with Splash... Eventually.

Currently contains 40 fusions between Splash and Vanilla Jokers! See the Collection ingame for more information!
Art is falling a bit behind... I still don't know how to do water.

Contains many, many additional ways to gain Splash or Splash copies outside the joker pool!

Also contains a deck, and full CardSleeves support for both decks! Check out the effects when combined with other decks...

Introducing Gold Fusions! Fuse a second Splash with a Splash Fusion Joker at a high price to power up its effects! Currently, only three fusions have Gold variants:
- Splish Splash
- Reflection
- Marie

More to come with time.

Gold Fusions can be disabled in the Mod Config menu.
